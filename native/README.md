Running Android 17 directly on the phone's kernel, the way Termux runs its
programs: Android's core libraries are rebuilt from AOSP source for the app's
folder, instead of a second kernel (UMLDroid's User-Mode Linux) or runtime
interception.

Step 1 (this commit): build Android 17's own bionic (`libc.so`, `linker64`),
unchanged, from a minimal AOSP checkout on GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/bionic.yml`, projects in `bionic-projects.txt`).
